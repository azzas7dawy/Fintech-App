# fintech_app

The app allows users to follow the crypto market, manage a portfolio, and simulate buy/sell flows using real-time market data.

What makes this project stand out is how it’s engineered:

Clean Architecture for scalability and maintainability

Dev / Prod flavors

CI/CD automation

Unit & Integration testing

Security was a first-class requirement:

Biometric authentication

Encrypted local storage

Screenshot prevention & background protection

Auto-lock after inactivity

Secure session & token handling

This project reflects my approach to Flutter development:
building secure, scalable apps with long-term maintainability in mind.
